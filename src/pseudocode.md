## Test Driven Developement

### Using the evercraft documentation create Tests 
<!-- 
1.) Create test to make sure the character exists by asserting the character is not equal to None
2.) Create Test for create name by asserting the name is not equal to None 
3.) Create test for character name by setting the new name to a variable 
3.A) variable name is now equal to the name of the character then asserting the character name is not equal to None
3.B) set the variable name of character2 by running through the same function 
4.) Check to make sure you can change names by updating the name of the character after creation 
4.A) set character you are changing to a variable and then set the new name equal to a variable as well
4.B) add new character name to the current name and push
5.) set alignment (you will need to always send both name and alignment every time you create the character)
6) Creating a character give it an ac rating, default to 10 
6. A) After creating a character can the ac be updated to a different number
7) Create a character and make a health to 5
7. A) Can a character damage another characeter and change the health by 1
7. B) Can a character damage another character with a critical hit and do more damage
7. C) Can a character damage another player
